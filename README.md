## Supported Mitsubishi Electrict Units
Basically, if the unit has a [`CN105`](https://github.com/dzungpv/mitsubishi2MQTT/blob/master/hardware/CN105.jpg) header on the main board, it should
work. The [HeatPump
wiki](https://github.com/SwiCago/HeatPump/wiki/Supported-models) has a long confirmed list.

The same [`CN105`](https://github.com/dzungpv/mitsubishi2MQTT/blob/master/hardware/CN105.jpg) connector is used by the Mitsubishi KumoCloud remotes, which
have a
[compatibility list](https://www.mitsubishicomfort.com/themes/custom/MitsubishiMegaSite/src/pdf/M_Submittal_kumo_cloud.pdf)
available.

The software and hardware has been tested by the author for 5 years on the following units:
* `MSZ-HL25VA`
* `MSZ-GE25VA`
* `MSY-GM24VA`

## Demo Circuit

<img src="https://github.com/dzungpv/mitsubishi2MQTT/blob/master/hardware/CN105_ESP8266.png"/>

This circuit using by the author, here is some [boards](https://github.com/dzungpv/mitsubishi2MQTT/blob/master/hardware/Before_Install.jpg) before install.

You can also use ESP-32 module for more processing power. If using ESP-32 by default app use UART1 (TX - GPIO 10, RX - GPIO 9)
You can assign any compatible pin in the SETUP->OTHERS to use custom pin, example TX: 26, RX: 27, check ESP-32 manual for pin, when TX and RX set it will use UART2 port. Better not using UART0, it is default for logs and flash the chip.
You can see more pictures in [`hardware`](https://github.com/dzungpv/mitsubishi2MQTT/tree/master/hardware) folder.

## Attention:
:warning: You have to open the indoor unit to have access to the `CN105` port. You should disconnected the main power before install the module. 
Faulty handling may cause leakage of water, electric shock or fire! :warning:

## How to use:
 - Step 1: Flash the sketch with flash size include SPIFFS option.
 - Step 2: Connect to device AP with name HVAC-XXXXXXXXXXXX (XXXX... 12 character MAC address)
 - Step 3: You should be automatically redirected to the web portal or go to 192.168.4.1
 - Step 4: Set Wifi information, mqtt(optional), language and save & reboot. Fall back to AP mode if WiFi connection fails (AP password sets to default SSID name from step 2).
 - Step 5: Connect to the device I with local domain: HVAC-XXXXXXXXXXXX.local
 - Step 6: (optional): Set MQTT information for use with Home Assistant
 - Step 7: (optional): Set Login password to prevent unwanted access in SETUP->ADVANCE->Login Password
 - Step 8: (optional): Turn off heat mode or quiet mode in SETUP->UNIT

Nightly builds are available for select platforms via GitHub Actions. Go to [the workflow](https://github.com/dzungpv/mitsubishi2MQTT/actions/workflows/build.yml), select the latest build, then check the **Artifacts** section. 

***

## How to build code from source:
  - ESP IDF (Recomended): clone the project with --recursive tag: ```git clone https://github.com/dzungpv/mitsubishi2MQTT.git --recursive```, Install [ESP IDF 4.4.6 ](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.4/esp32/get-started/index.html) set the target and run command: idf.py build
  - Arduino: Intall require libraries (name and path in platformio.ini), rename file main.cpp in main folder to main.ino, open it and build
  - Platformio: Install, open it and choose a variant to build

## MQTT topic use cases
The `topic` is: "mqtt_topic/mqtt_friendly_name"
- topic/power/set OFF
- topic/mode/set AUTO HEAT COOL DRY FAN_ONLY OFF ON
- topic/temp/set 16-31
- topic/remote_temp/set also called "room_temp", the implementation defined in "HeatPump" seems not work in some models
- topic/fan/set 1-4 AUTO QUIET
- topic/vane/set 1-5 SWING AUTO
- topic/wide-vane/set << < | > >>
- topic/settings
- topic/state
- topic/debug/packets
- topic/debug/packets/set on off
- topic/debug/logs
- topic/debug/logs/set on off
- topic/custom/send as example "fc 42 01 30 10 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 7b " see https://github.com/SwiCago/HeatPump/blob/master/src/HeatPump.h
- topic/system/set to control the device with commands: "restart": reboot the device, "factory": reset device to fatory state.
